# Smart-Agriculture-System
Smart Agriculture System using C is a console-based project that simulates an automatic irrigation system. It monitors soil moisture, temperature, humidity, TDS, and turbidity, and controls irrigation using threshold-based logic. The pump operates only when soil is dry and water quality is safe, helping reduce water wastage and protect crops.
